First we habe to overwrite registred method,

then define the action in this method,

after this add a new event in EventServiceProvider

in this eventer-provider add a new registered event with new App\Listners\SendWelcomeEmail

e.g

'Illuminate\Auth\Events\Registed' => [
	'App\Listners\SendWelcomeEmail'
]

it will send welcome email to newly registed users

make sure to run this command, php artisan event:generate

now in this SendWelcomeEmail class, add send email function in handle method;

e.g
Mail::to($event->user)->send(new WelcomeToOurApp ($event->user));

now run this command; php artisan make:mail WelcomeToOurApp --markdown="emails.welcome"

in WelcomeToOurApp.php apply User model dependancy injection in constructor

e.g
User $user

$this->user = $user

also declair public property $user before construct

now design the email.welcome.blade according to your interust
